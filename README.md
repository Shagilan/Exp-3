Create the following diagrams in StarUML:

Use Case Diagram

Class Diagram

Activity Diagram

Package Diagram

Communication Diagram

Sequence Diagram

1. Login: User logs into the system.

2. Check Availability: User selects the number of passengers and checks seat availability.

3. If Not Available, the process stops here.

4. Enter Details: User provides the required details for all passengers.
